# VisGym

VisGym is a stateful visual training environment. A policy receives an image,
emits one text action, and repeats until the task terminates. The canonical
environment config is `environments/visgym/config.yaml`; the implementation is
split between `resources_servers/visgym` and
`responses_api_agents/visgym_agent`.

## Prepare data

Generated training manifests and rendered assets are intentionally excluded
from Git. They are seeded and reproducible under the locked Gym toolchain, and
can be recreated through one entry point:

```bash
# Ordered 5x5, 7x7, 9x9, and 11x11 maze curriculum
python environments/visgym/prepare.py maze --samples-per-stage 1280

# Multi-environment manifests and their small seeded fixture assets
python environments/visgym/prepare.py multienv \
  --combine-envs maze_2d_7x7,maze_3d,jigsaw

# Experimental seed-only manifests derived from the public VisGym HF dataset.
# These do not reconstruct source init_args/extra_state; validate every local
# reset/solve contract before use.
python environments/visgym/prepare.py hf \
  --acknowledge-seed-only-reset \
  --output-dir resources_servers/visgym/data/hf_manifests
```

Use `python environments/visgym/prepare.py <dataset> --help` for all generator
options. Minimal example and smoke fixtures remain committed so a clean clone
can validate the config and run focused tests without downloading training
data.

## Run

```bash
gym env start --environment visgym --model-type vllm_model
```

See `resources_servers/visgym/README.md` for the lifecycle, action schemas,
reward shaping, optional dependencies, and larger multi-environment recipes.

## Why VisGym has a specialized server and agent

The base Gymnasium server and agent are useful for environments with string
observations and function-call actions. VisGym additionally requires
multimodal image messages, boxed text-action parsing, an explicit final reward
drain, and preservation of prompt/generation token metadata across every turn
for on-policy RL. Adapting the generic pair would change those public schemas,
so VisGym shares the same NeMo Gym base classes while keeping its specialized
transport layer.
